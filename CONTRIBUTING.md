## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

- Use **SwiftLint** configuration provided
- Follow **Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines**
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Architecture Principles

- **MVVM Pattern**: Separate views from business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies explicitly
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Use protocols for flexibility
- **Testability**: Write testable code

./run_tests.sh

# Run end-to-end tests
python3 run_e2e_tests.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Aim for **80%+ code coverage**
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

## Documentation

- Update **README.md** for user-facing changes
- Add **inline documentation** for public APIs
- Include **code examples** where helpful
- Keep documentation **up to date**

## Performance Guidelines

- Maintain **60fps** UI updates
- Optimize for **battery efficiency**
- Profile before and after changes
- Consider memory usage
